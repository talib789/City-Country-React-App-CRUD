 # CITY COUNTRY
## SCREENSHOTS
![](https://snipboard.io/CpAfcI.jpg)

### React Problem
- Create the following table in the home page
- use JSON server to manage the data
- create two endpoints on json server
- a list of countries
- a list of cities with country and population information
- Use redux and thunks to maintain application state
- Users shuold be able to filter the tabular data
- filter by country
- sort by asc or desc population
- delete a city
- when deleting a city, add a loading indicator or disable the delete button for that city only
- Add loading indicators for the web application whenever required
- use a UI library like Material UI
- id	Country	City	Population	Edit	Delete
- 1	India	Delhi	19,000,000	Edit	Delete
- 2	SriLanka	Colombo	5,600,000	Edit	Delete
- 3	USA	Chicago	2,920,000	Edit	Delete
- create a new route /add-country
- User should be able to add a new country from the /add-country route
- createa a new route /add-city
- User should be able to add a new city from the /add-city route
- When you add a new city, take the following fields
- City name, Population and Country it belongs to
- the countriese should be fetched from the list of countries that you have made
- When you click the Edit button, you should, bring up a modal, and allow a user to edit the details and update the data

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
